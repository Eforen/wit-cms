Contributing
============
If you'd like to contribute to `wit`, please fork its Github repository, make
your changes, and submit a pull-request.

Please note that one of `wit`'s primary advantages is its simplicity and small
codebase, so I am not interested in bloating it with "features". With that
said, you may wish to contact me before you make modifications if you're
interested in seeing your changes merged upstream.

Bug fixes will always be accepted.
